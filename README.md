# centralised-hazard-monitoring-system
A real-time hazard detection system monitoring floods, fires, and air quality using sensors like MQ-7, MQ-135, DHT11, rain, soil moisture, and IR flame sensors. Data is collected by a Raspberry Pi Pico, sent via UART to a Pico 2W, and transmitted wirelessly to a laptop for real-time monitoring on an Excel-based web dashboard.
